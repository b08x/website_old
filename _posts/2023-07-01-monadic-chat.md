[Monadic Chat](https://yohasebe.github.io/monadic-chat/overview) is a Ruby library that functions as a flexible LLM application framework.

With a simple and practical UI crafted using JS TailwindCSS along with a Ruby ERB template, Monadic Chat by [Yoichiro Hasebe](https://github.com/yohasebe) distinguishes itself as a remarkably well-constructed OpenAI client.

> A monad is a type of data structure in functional programming that allows chaining operations together while encapsulating the context or environment...Many such monadic processes surround us, and natural language discourse is one of them. A "chat" between a human user and an AI agent can be thought of as a form of natural language discourse...

Conversations with the AI can be saved in a JSON file, and the saved JSON file can be loaded later to continue a conversation. Using the CLI, a conversation data can also be converted to HTML and displayed in a web browser.
