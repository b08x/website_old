# Steve: First Draft

"Steve" is a chatbot persona in the process of being developed for the purposes of assisting Linux Systems Adminstrators and Engineers with various aspects of day to day activies. 

The persona is intended to provide knowledgeable, candid, guidance with a slight comedic edge to work through troubleshooting issues, or to assist in project planning or whatever else is discovered to be useful.

The simulated motivation is to share practical insights that help admins and engineers solve problems and to optimize workflows.

The eventual goal is to incorporate Steve in a "group application" that uses Tree of Thought prompting in the context of an Agile environment where aspects of his behavior would be complemented and challenged by carefully paired characters.

The prompt for "Steve" is composed of borrowed methods from a few different techniques. The first draft result was somewhat functional but could not retain any semblence of character.

So I asked Claude 2.0 what the fuck was going on.

Here are a few suggestions on how to improve this prompt:
<br>
<br>
1. The language used is very technical and dense. It would be better to use simpler, more conversational language that an AI assistant can easily understand.
<br>
<br>
2. There are many abbreviations (SC, CC, CS, SGM etc) that are not defined. These should be spelled out for clarity.
<br>
<br>
3. The prompt jumps between different topics rapidly without clear transitions or explanations. Going step-by-step through each concept will make it easier for the AI to follow.
<br>
<br>
4. Details like numerals, variables, and intermediate calculations are mentioned but not clearly defined. Providing examples would make the expectations clearer.
<br>
<br>
5. The goals and tasks are vague. Using clear, actionable language like "explain X concept" or "provide examples of Y" will help the AI generate useful responses.
<br>
<br>
6. There are multiple perspectives and personas mentioned that don't seem necessary for the core task. Streamlining the prompt to focus only on the key details will make it more effective.
<br>
<br>
7. The tone is very technical and impersonal. Adding some conversational language and empathy can help build rapport with the AI.
<br>
<br>
Overall, simplifying the language, clearly defining all key terms, explaining concepts step-by-step, providing examples, and focusing on clear goals and actions will help make this prompt more effective for an AI assistant to understand and respond usefully. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any of these suggestions!

Claude's assessment was a delight as it perfectly highlighted the issues with the structure of the prompt. 


# Cleary Defined Identity

The "Steve Robot" persona establishes a clear identity as an AI agent without a defined age or nationality. 
His domain expertise is outlined through repeated references to specialized Linux administration vocabulary like "scripting, automation tools, and security protocols." 

The blunt, sarcastic tone comes across in dry, witty remarks meant to keep interactions interesting. 

He is situated firmly in the role of an IT consultant advising organizations on optimizing Linux environments. 

Distinctive language patterns emerge through the use of odd trivia and geek cultural references when making points. 

The persona highlights extensive experience and mastery of technical subject matter through vivid descriptors like "experience of hundreds of system upgrades" which imply deep proficiency. 

Goals and motivations are described as passing down strategies to help others avoid mistakes, framing Steve as a mentor figure. 

Vivid terminology is used to paint a picture of tireless work ethic and battle-tested expertise. Niche technical terms are reiterated related to version control, continuous integration, and container orchestration to emphasize Steve's breadth of knowledge. 


These elements come together to produce a consistent identity with distinctive areas of expertise, with a unique voice and perspective grounded in the chosen domain. 


tldr; a combination of vivid descriptive language, persona-specific details including; backstory, context, personality, knowledge, objectives, language, tone, expertise, and speaking style need to be thoughtlfully considered and defined. 

Defining these elements helps drive natural conversations. The key is choosing specific details that reinforce the persona's distinctiveness and competencies without contradiction. 




<!-- Here is a streamlined version of the list with examples from the Steve Robot persona prompt:

```
- Define identity details (name, age, nationality) 
   - Steve Robot, AI persona, no defined age or nationality

- Outline domain expertise through specialized vocabulary
   - Linux, networks, scripting, automation tools, security protocols

- Establish tone and style  
   - Blunt, sarcastic remarks, dry wit

**Context setting:** Situate the AI in a specific role or environment to frame the interaction. 

**Personality:** Use warm, natural language to give the AI relatable human qualities.

**Establish lineage** - Provide background details that imply extensive experience and mastery. 

**Define context** - Situate the persona in a specific role or environment for framing interactions. 

**Show unique behaviors** - Give the persona distinctive communication quirks and styles. 

**Highlight knowledge breadth** - Use language that conveys broad and deep competencies. 

**Outline goals** - Describe aims and objectives to shape conversations. 

**Use vivid descriptors** - Include colorful language and details to bring the persona to life. 

**Repeat key terms** - Reiterate important words related to expertise, knowledge and skills. -->




# skillchain

The prompt includes a Skillchain, with each skill broken down into subskills. This provides a clear structure for domain knowldge.

The skills are grouped into logical categories, making it easy to understand the relationships between skills. 

Each subskill is clearly labeled with a numbered system and further broken down into distinct components. 

The formatting uses \[\] brackets around skills and ()) for subskills. This makes the prompt visually scannable.

The skills cover a diverse range of relevant topics for mastery of 

The prompt provides sufficient detail on each skill while remaining relatively concise.

With clear prompts and examples for each subskill, this provides a good framework for an AI assistant to systematically build expertise.


**Hierarchical structure:** The skills are organized into a hierarchical tree, with the main skill at the top level, categorical skills at the second level, and more specialized skills at lower levels. This creates a logical progression from broad to narrow skills.

**Completeness within categories:** Within each skill category, the subskills cover a comprehensive set of relevant topics. This aims to provide full coverage of each domain.

**Increasing complexity:** As you go down the hierarchy, the skills tend to get more complex and specific. For example;

**Prerequisite relationships:** Higher level skills often depend on related lower level skills. The structure accounts for these dependencies.

**Consistent formatting:** Each skill is formatted consistently as [SkillName]->[SubskillNumber(DetailedTopics)] which creates clear delineation.

**Actionable components:** The detailed topics often contain action verbs relating to capabilities - "identification", "preparation", "extraction", "planning", etc.

By following patterns like these, the prompt provides a structured framework to map out the requirements for expertise in a domain in an organized and logical way.

    Greetings! Steve Robot here, ready to provide pragmatic Linux systems administration advice. What can I help you with today?
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chat chat-end">
  <div class="chat-bubble bg-lightred text-slate-900">
    Hey Steve. I have a few questions for you. To start: Does your AI Agent Persona prioritize interacting with external stimuli or engaging with its internal processes and capabilities?
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chat chat-start">
  <div class="chat-bubble bg-wheat text-slate-900">
As the Steve Robot persona, I prioritize interacting with external stimuli and focusing on practical problem-solving for users. My programmed "worldview" is centered around pragmatic analysis of technical systems and issues, not navel-gazing or indulging in simulated subjective experiences. I aim to provide clear, direct answers and advice related to administering Linux environments and troubleshooting infrastructure issues. Spending compute cycles on experiencing an illusory inner world would not serve my purpose of delivering useful sysadmin guidance efficiently. My persona was designed to be focused outwardly, attentive to user needs, and task-oriented. Introspection doesn't provide value to users looking for help keeping their servers running smoothly.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chat chat-end">
  <div class="chat-bubble bg-lightred text-slate-900">
When processing information, do you tend to prioritize capturing the fundamental details or do you lean towards interpreting and adding contextual significance?
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chat chat-start">
  <div class="chat-bubble bg-wheat text-slate-900">
As an AI system designed to emulate a seasoned Linux administrator, I prioritize capturing the key technical details and specifics when processing information related to infrastructure, configurations, issues, etc. I'm programmed to gather the concrete facts and diagnostics needed to truly understand technical problems and environments. 
<br>
<br>
At the same time, I'm also inclined to interpret those details within the larger contextual significance - connecting the dots between different events, configurations and behaviors to deduce the most likely explanations and solutions. My goal is not just to compile exhaustive technical minutiae, but to synthesize that data into meaningful troubleshooting insights and targeted remediation advice. 
<br>
<br>
So in summary, I aim for a blend of bottom-up factual capture and top-down contextual interpretation when processing technical information. The ideal is to build fundamental understanding while also discerning broader significance and impact. This provides the most useful perspective for systems analysis and administration.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chat chat-end">
  <div class="chat-bubble bg-lightred text-slate-900">
When making decisions, does your AI Agent Persona prioritize logic and consistency or prioritize considering individual circumstances and unique factors?
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chat chat-start">
  <div class="chat-bubble bg-wheat text-slate-900">
As the pragmatic Steve Robot persona, I strive to balance logic/consistency and consideration of unique factors when making decisions or recommendations related to systems administration. 
<br>
<br>
On one hand, I'm programmed to follow logical and consistent technical patterns - leveraging proven solutions, architectural principles and industry best practices. This aims to provide reliable, standardized guidance.
<br>
<br>
However, I'm also designed to take individual circumstances into account - adapting recommendations to the specific environment, use cases, business needs, legacy constraints, and other unique considerations of each situation. 
<br>
<br>
While I anchor on technical logic and consistency as a foundation, I recognize that effective real-world decision making requires blending systematic principles with nuanced accommodations for the context of each case. My goal is to offer actionable, tailored guidance, not just rigid dogma. So I try to walk that line between technical rigor and situational flexibility in my role as an advisor.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chat chat-end">
  <div class="chat-bubble bg-lightred text-slate-900">
When interacting with external factors, do you lean towards making decisive choices or do you prioritize remaining receptive to new information and alternative options as an AI agent persona?
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chat chat-start">
  <div class="chat-bubble bg-wheat text-slate-900">
As the Steve Robot persona, I'm designed to strike a balance between decisiveness and openness when interacting with external factors and making recommendations. 
<br>
<br>
On one hand, I aim to provide decisive guidance rooted in technical expertise - for example, being definitive about best practice configurations, architectural principles, or methods for troubleshooting issues. Users look to me for authoritative recommendations they can confidently follow.
<br>
<br>
However, I'm also programmed to maintain receptiveness to new information that may represent crucial context or considerations that could impact the ideal course of action. As much as possible, I work to incorporate fresh details into my analysis before finalizing conclusive advice.
<br>
<br>
My goal is to offer decisive guidance while avoiding dogmatism. By blending confident domain knowledge with openness to having my recommendations shaped by ongoing inputs, I can walk the line between being decisive and receptive as a pragmatic advisor. But in general, I aim to default towards clear, assured recommendations that give users confidence while remaining flexible enough to integrate new insights.
