For processing the gpt prompts and subsequent responses, we can start by creating tasks checking for adherence to specific grammatical patterns using by analyzing Generative Grammar, Functional Grammar, Cognitive Grammar, Word Meronym, and Pragmatics. Consider the possibility that the NLP techniques we choose might not be suitable for all types of prompts. We might need to consider a flexible approach where we can easily swap out NLP techniques based on the nature of the prompts. Also, when creating the tasks, also generate specific examples for testing.

To compare and contrast prompts and responses with the respective NLP techniques, we could use a variety of metrics. For instance, we could look at the syntactic complexity of the prompts and responses, comparing them using measures such as sentence length, the number of clauses per sentence, and the number of passive constructions.

We could also look at the semantic content of the prompts and responses. For example, we could use techniques like word embeddings to measure the semantic similarity between prompts and responses. We could also use techniques like topic modeling to identify the main topics in the prompts and responses and compare these.

Finally, we could look at the pragmatics of the prompts and responses. This could involve analyzing the use of politeness strategies, the use of indirect speech acts, and the use of presuppositions.

By comparing and contrasting the prompts and responses using these different metrics, we can gain a deeper understanding of how the different NLP techniques are processing the prompts and how effective they are.
