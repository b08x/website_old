[Monadic Chat](https://yohasebe.github.io/monadic-chat/overview) is a flexible web application framework that allows you to create chatbots. It uses OpenAI's Chat and Whisper APIs, as well as the Ruby programming language.

With a user-friendly UI crafted Ruby, Monadic Chat by [Yoichiro Hasebe](https://github.com/yohasebe) distinguishes itself as a remarkably well-constructed OpenAI client.
