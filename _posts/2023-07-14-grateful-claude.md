  <p>Here is a condensed and synthesized version of the Ansible and Azure environment description:</p>

  <p>Implemented highly available Azure infrastructure with Ansible configuration management.</p>

  <p>Built 2 redundant CentOS 7 application hosts behind Azure load balancer. Added/removed hosts from pool using maintenance page.</p>

  <p>Restricted access to Ansible control node only via SSH. Developed playbooks to add approved users. Disabled root login and 'su'.</p>

  <p>Deployed Nginx, PHP-FPM, Ruby, Node.js stack. Installed packages via bundle, composer, npm during deploy.</p>
  <p>Stored environment variables in templates, loaded on application deploy.</p>

  <p>Automated serial application deployments. Removed host from pool, pulled code changes, reloaded Nginx, added host back.</p>

  <p>Configured master-slave database replication for disaster recovery. Promoted read-only slave to master if needed.</p>

  <p>Implemented encrypted Xtrabackup database backups on slave after replication sync.</p>

  <p>Provided centralized recovery management for multi-environment with custom scripts.</p>

  <p>Planned transition to fully automated deployments via Git hooks triggering Ansible playbooks.</p>

  <p>Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand on any part of this summarized description. I aimed to condense the key points into a clear, high-level overview showcasing the Ansible automation and Azure high availability.</p>
