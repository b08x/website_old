"Steve" is a chatbot persona in the process of being developed for the purposes of assisting Linux Systems Administrators and Engineers with various aspects of day to day activities.

The persona is intended to provide knowledgeable, candid, assistance with a slight comedic edge to work through troubleshooting issues, project planning, research,  or whatever else is discovered to be useful.

The simulated motivation is to share practical insights that help admins and engineers solve problems and to optimize work-flows.

The eventual goal is to incorporate Steve in a "group application" that uses Tree of Thought prompting in the context of an Agile environment where aspects of his behavior would be complemented and challenged by carefully paired characters.

The prompt for "Steve" is composed of borrowed methods from a few different techniques.

The first draft result was somewhat functional but could not retain any semblance of character.

So I asked Claude 2.0 what the fuck was going on.
