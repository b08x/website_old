        > Orchestration is about bringing together disparate things into a coherent whole. In the classical sense, you’ve got strings, brass, woodwinds and percussion, all with their own separate sheet music, with a conductor at the helm to ensure organization and timing in order to produce harmony instead of  cacophony.... Once you’ve orchestrated and arranged your musical composition, it becomes available for anyone to use at any level.
